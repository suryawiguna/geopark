                        For the worship natural world, the Balinese Hindu builds temple as adaptation and presentation of mountain-like figure. It is designed as an open air worship place within enclosed walls, connected with series of intricately decorated gates to reach its compounds. 27 Pura are found around Batur Caldera. The temple buildings made from carved stone of andesitic-basaltic lava that produced by the Batur Volcano. Some of Pura are categorized as archaeological site. Contrary to elswhere in Hindu Bali, the Trunyanese do not cremate their dead. Instead, after a ritual cleansing with rain water, the body of the deceased is placed in a bamboo cage under the taru menyan tree until the forces of nature, in particular the wind, has dissolved the body tissues and only the skeleton remains.
                        <br><br>
                        In local philosophy, Batur Caldera is believed possessing four main components of the earth, i.e. land, water, fire, and air, as the spiritual aspects of nature. They worship the natural world and they believe themselves as an inextricable part of it. They are participants within the web of life, not caretakers living outside. The spirits that inhabited forest, volcano, and lake could be magnanimous ormalevolent, depending on circumstances.

As one of the Pura Kahyangan Jagat, Pura Ulun Danu Batur is one of the most important temples in Bali which acted as the maintainer of harmony and stability of the entire island. Pura Ulun Danu Batur represents the direction of North and is dedicated to the god Vishnu and the local goddess Dewi Danu, goddess of Lake Batur, the largest lake in Bali. Following the destruction of the original temple compound, the temple was relocated and rebuilt in 1926.

However, it also becomes a nice reference to spend a vacation in Bangli Regency. Not only the temple is beautiful, but it also offers a serene atmosphere which is good for relaxation. The name itself is unique, which means a teak.

The good thing is tourists can also join and watch the ceremony directly during the visit. At the time, villagers prepare some offerings and conduct a ritual called Widhi Widana! Well, for more information regarding the rite, everyone should consider hiring a guide while exploring the temple later.

                                                This temple has been established since 1926, a little story about the history of this temple, if from the meaning of its name, Ulun Danu means Goddess Lake. The local community believes that the history of the temple is closely related to the lake water goddess known as Dewi Danu. The main function of the establishment of this temple is to offer to Dewi Danu because Balinese people feel very grateful for the flow of mineral-rich water from Lake Batur which then flows through their rice fields.

                                                The first unique story is closely related to the name given to the temple itself, namely Pura Dalem Balingkang. The name was given to this temple because indeed at the beginning, this temple was a palace of a Balingkang (which in Balinese means king) named Sri Jaya Pangus. The building could be said to have a fairly ancient architectural style. Such temple buildings are indeed quite rare to find, including in Bali itself.

                                        A complex irrigation system has been made to make the most of water. In the form of gratitude for water which enables agricultural activities Balinese people make rituals on irrigation systems. This irrigation system also allows coordination between farmers known as the "subak" organizational system. The organization is a democratic organization; farmers who use the same water source, meet regularly for deliberations and coordinate planting, control the distribution of irrigation water, plan development, maintain canals and dams and organize ceremonies and offerings at the Subak Temple

Subak generally have a temple called Pura Uluncarik or Pura Bedugul, which is specially built by landowners and farmers. The temple is intended for Dewi Sri, the goddess of prosperity and fertility according to Balinese beliefs. This irrigation system is regulated by a traditional leader (Pekaseh) who is also a farmer in Bali.

                                                Subak has been studied by Clifford Geertz, while other researchers such as J. Stephen Lansing have attracted general attention about the importance of traditional irrigation systems. He studied temples in Bali, especially those intended for agriculture which are usually forgotten by foreigners. In 1987 Lansing collaborated with Balinese farmers to develop a Subak irrigation system computer model. With that he proved the effectiveness of Subak and the importance of this system
